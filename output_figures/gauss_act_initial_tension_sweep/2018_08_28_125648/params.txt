created a new function (find activation gauss v2), that preferentially selected activation levels that were lower over time subject to MaxStep=default.

Appears to keep the activations low, which keeps the errors in a bizarre range. Maybe we just need to do the optimal control (ability to shut off muscles) that creates regions when the error is quite large.
