For this trial, we chose the smallest activation level (LB for most trials). We will change the algorithm to slect the overall inverse constraint function (i.e., closest input to the origin) but will have to be careful not to select any negative inputs. It is weird that the muscle lengths will actually fail to follow the trace for non-contracting segments. It does, however, make sense that the overall error will be largely a function of the already low initial tensions. If this is the analysis that needs to be done, then the lower the force on the tendons as a whole, the larger the overall error. 

May need to see how this analysis holds for the 02 reference trajectory.
