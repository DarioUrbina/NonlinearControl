Ran the sim for 10 seconds. I appears the drift reaches a plateau. 

Additionally, I still dont know if the reason for the large initial error is mainly due to the level of pretensioning associated with the muscle. We could try to find the value of T(0) that minimized the error and see if that can be chosen as the pretensioning.
