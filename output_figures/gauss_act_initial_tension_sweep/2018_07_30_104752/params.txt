Identified the source of the "Fuzziness" in the error plots. The equation for tendon tension utilized the pennation angle to determine the \delta l_{T} from MTU and muscle. This value will change the error when the pennation angle is not equal to zero. 

Corrected error function takes muscle length into consideration in order to correct for this error.
